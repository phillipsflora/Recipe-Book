    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <br>
    <pre>Step 1
        Combine 1 large russet potato (about 10 oz.), 
        peeled, cut into 1" pieces, 1 small carrot, peeled,
         sliced crosswise ½" thick, 2 cups frozen cauliflower
          florets, ½ cup frozen green peas, 2 Tbsp. unsalted 
          butter, and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton 
          kosher salt in a medium saucepan. Pour in 1 cup water
           and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, 
           and cook until potato is falling apart and carrot and 
           cauliflower are tender, 12–18 minutes. Remove from heat
            and mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth,
             but not quite a purée. Cover and keep warm.
        
        Step 2
        Set aside ½ cup finely chopped red onions (from 2
     large red onions, finely chopped) for serving. Heat
      2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a medium Dutch oven or other 
      heavy pot over medium-high. Cook 2 tsp. cumin seeds 
      until fragrant and a shade darker, about 45 seconds.
       Add remaining red onions to pot along with 1 medium 
       green bell pepper, ribs and seeds removed, finely chopped
       , one 2" piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped, 8 garlic 
       cloves, finely chopped, and remaining 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal 
       or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally,
        until onions are translucent and golden brown in spots, 10–15 
        minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
        , 3 Tbsp. double-concentrated tomato paste, 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp.
         ground coriander, 1 Tbsp. ground cumin, 1 Tbsp. sweet paprika, 
         1 tsp. cayenne pepper, ½ tsp. ground turmeric, and ¼ cup water.
          Cook, stirring often to ensure spices don’t stick and burn, 
          until mixture is slightly darkened, 6–8 minutes. Pour in another 
          ¼ cup water and cook, stirring often, until oil beads on surface
           of aromatics, about 5 minutes.
        
        Step 3
        Scrape mashed vegetables into pot with aromatics;
         add 1 tsp. garam masala and 1 cup water. Cook, 
         stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water 
         if needed, until mixture is homogeneous and slightly
          thickened (texture should be loose, similar to risotto)
          , 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 3 Tbsp. 
          unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice. Taste and 
          add more salt if needed. Transfer bhaji to a large shallow 
          bowl and top with a few pats of butter, reserved red onions
          , and ½ cup finely chopped cilantro.
        
        Step 4
        Heat 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large skillet, 
        preferably cast iron, over medium. Working in
         batches and adding more butter between batches if
          pan looks dry, toast 6–8 potato rolls, cut side 
          down, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
        
        Step 5
        Serve bhaji with potato rolls and lime wedges.
