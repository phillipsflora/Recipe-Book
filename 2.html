    <h3><ul>First, boil the yellow moong dal. I use my Instant pot to make my dal, rinse and drain the moong dal. Add drained moong dal to the inner pot and add 2 cups water to it.
    </ul><ul>Close the lid and set the pressure cooker/Manual mode to 6 minutes, vent in sealing position. Let the pressure release naturally.
        </ul><ul>In a big mixing bowl, add salt, melted butter/ghee, red chili powder, sesame seeds, Ajwain/Carom seeds to rice flour and mix it all in.
      </ul> <ul> Cut the butter into the flour, so it forms a short crust kinda dough.
        </ul>
    <li>Add the boiled moong dal and mix it in. Its important to add the moong dal lukewarm or hot to make the dough, this will make the murukku light and crispy.
<li>Mix it all together to make a soft yet stiff dough.
</li><li>You probably wont need any water, but just in case the dough is too stiff, add a couple tablespoons of warm water and mix the dough.
</li><li>Grease the murukku press mould on the inside with Avocado oil spray, Fix the star plate on one side and stuff the dough into the mould.
</li><li>Close it up and gently press the dough into nice spirals onto a parchment paper. You can adjust the spiral shape with your hand as you keep on pressing.
