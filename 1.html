<h5>Hot and Spicy|Chilli Cheese Toast | 5 Min Snack Recipe preparation 
    <br>with step by step photos and a quick video. Chilli cheese toast is 
    <br>one of the easiest evening snacks. It can be quickly prepared in no 
    <br>time. I have added garlic, green chilies, and chili flakes which makes
    <br>this snack more spice and yummy. I have used mozzarella cheese which 
    <br>is soft fresh cheese prepared from Cow’s milk. It has a mild flavor 
    <br>with a flexible and rubbery texture. I have used Tawa and kept the 
    <br>stove in low flame to prevent the bread from burning before cheese melts.
    <br>You can use white bread, brown bread, multigrain bread, or whole wheat 
    <br>bread.
