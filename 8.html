        <pre><h3>Rava Idli Recipe | How to Make Suji Idli | Instant Semolina Idli with 
            step-by-step photo and video recipe. South Indian recipes are generally popular
            for their steamed and clean breakfast recipes. It is either dosa or idli which 
            covers most of the breakfast recipe offerings. One such easy and simple idli recipe
            is the rava idli recipe which is not only tasty but also quick and easy to make.
            Idli recipes are a common meal in my house and I make them frequently for 
            breakfast and also for lunch boxes. I try to make different types of idli 
            recipes and hence it does not make a monotonous morning meal. Having said that,
            rava idli or semolina idli is very consistent in our weekly menu. Perhaps because 
            this recipe does not require previous day preparation and also no overnight fermentation. 
            This is a huge bonus for me. So in other words, I have to mix all the wet and dry
            ingredients to make the idli batter. Once the batter is prepared, it has to be just
            steamed to soft and spongy idli.Thatâ€™s it! healthy and tasty idli is ready within no time.</h3></pre>
